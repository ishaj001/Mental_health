Roughly 20% of adults are coping with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or ADHD. 
In the tech industry, characterized by a high-stress work environment, long hours, constant availability expectations, 
and a blending of professional and personal life due to open-source commitments, it's crucial to ensure that individuals most 
vulnerable to mental health challenges receive support and aren't left behind. This can be achieved through proactive mental
health initiatives, destigmatizing mental health conversations, promoting work-life balance, and offering resources and
assistance to tech professionals facing these challenges.
